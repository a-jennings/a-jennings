# Hi I'm Drew! 👋

### I'm an aspiring Fullstack Web Developer!

Hi! My name is Drew, an aspiring web developer who has recently completed a coding bootcamp with Le Wagon! After finishing working abroad for 4 years in the French Alps, I decided to take my previous mechanical engineering skills and focus on a starting a career in web development and computer programming. 

Previously I worked as a property maintenance worker in the French Alps for a large tour operator, where I got to do a lot of snowboarding in my off time!

Before that I did an apprenticeship in commercial and domestic mechanical gas engineering.

Other hobbies include trying to work through a ever growing video game collection, and being an experienced Dungeon Master.

Thanks for stopping by! 🖖
